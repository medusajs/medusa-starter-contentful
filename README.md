## Run your project
  ```
  yarn seed
  medusa develop
  ```

Your local Medusa server is now running on port **9000**. 

Everytime you create or update Products, Product Variants or Regions Contentful and Medusa data will be synced.

## What's inside
This starter uses `medusa-plugin-contentful` to synchronize data between your Medusa store and your Contentful space.

In the `/contentful-migrations` directory you will find migration files to setup content types in Contentful.
The content types can be used to build pages for your webiste and include:

- **Page**: Represents a page on your website. Each page has a title and can take any number of "Content Modules". Content Modules can be either of the type Hero or Tile Section.
- **Hero**: a component that can take a Title, CTA and a background image.
- **Tile**: a component that can be added to a Tile Section and renders a Title, CTA and an Image.
- **Tile Section**: a component that can hold a number of Tiles or Products. When used with a Product, the Tile Section will display the product thumbnail and it's title and will link to the product page.
- **Link**: a component that can link to an external or internal path; or, alternatively, hold a reference to a Page or Product entry. If used with Page or Product, the link path will be infered from the referenced entry.
- **Navigation Item**: an item to include in a Navigation Menu. Each navigation item has a title that can be displayed in a menu and a link that defines where the user will be navigated to when the item is clicked.
- **Product**: represents a product as syncronized from Medusa. A product's variants will be copied over as well.
- **Product Variant**: The variants of a product.
- **Region**: Represents an available region in Medusa.

The the `seed:contentful` script will will use this content modules to add some test data for you to get started with. The test data includes:
- A home page with a hero, some featured products and the tools used.
- An about page with a hero that links to the Medusa website.
- A product overview page that can be configured to show products in the store.

> Note: After seeding your database and starting your server you will have to publish the copied products in Contentful and add them to "Featured Products" Tile Section.

## Try it out

```
curl -X GET localhost:9000/store/products | python -m json.tool
```

After the seed script has run you will have the following things in you database:

- a User with the email: admin@medusa-test.com and password: supersecret
